# summary

Generate a new sf plugin.

# description

This command is interactive. You're prompted for information to populate your new plugin, such as its name, description, author, and percentage of code coverage you want. The command clones the 'salesforcecli/plugin-template-sf' GitHub repository, installs the plug-in's npm package dependencies using yarn install, and updates the package properties.

When the command completes, your new plugin contains the source, message, and test files for a sample "sf hello world" command.
